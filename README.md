# Web and Text Sentimental Analysis

## Overview
This project demonstrates various techniques for sentiment analysis on textual data, utilizing different models and embedding methods. Sentiment analysis is a crucial aspect of Natural Language Processing (NLP), helping to determine the emotional tone behind words. This repository includes implementations using FastText, GloVe, and Word2Vec.

## Repository Structure
- `Sentimental_Analysis_1.ipynb`: Basic sentiment analysis example.
- `Sentimental_Analysis_FastText.ipynb`: Sentiment analysis using FastText embeddings.
- `Sentimental_Analysis_GLoVe.ipynb`: Sentiment analysis using GloVe embeddings.
- `Sentimental_Analysis_Main.ipynb`: Main notebook combining various methods.
- `Sentimental_Analysis_Word2vec.ipynb`: Sentiment analysis using Word2Vec embeddings.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**
